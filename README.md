# Geoimage-File-Zipper

This program was created to zip Shapefile exports in an efficient manner.

Made this because I once had to zip files for 3 hours one day and could find a tool to fulfill my requirements.

Feel free to use! especially if you are working with shapefiles in the geospatial industry and with a lot of features / layers.
