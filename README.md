# Geoimage-File-Zipper

This program was created to zip Shapefile exports in an efficient manner.

Made this because I once had to zip files for 3 hours one day. I thought, "surely there is a better way to do this". I couldn't find one, so I made one.

Feel free to use! especially if you are working with shapefiles in the geospatial industry and with a lot of features / layers.

Was a nooby when I made this so also feel free to ignore all the ugly code and lack of best practice. Still runs in O(n) !!!!
